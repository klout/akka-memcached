akka-memcached
==============

async, non-blocking memcached client using akka

inspired by, but much simpler than, this project: https://github.com/derekjw/fyrie-redis

info on akka io / iteratee library: http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.3/scala/io.html


Features
--------
 * Supports set, get, and delete instructions
 * All instructions are non-blocking.
 * Set and Delete instructions are fire-and-forget, get instructions return Akka Futures
 * Uses consistent hashing to distribute data across multiple memcached servers
 * Deduplicates keys: If two clients make a request for the same key, only one call to Memcached will be made



How to build
------------
 * Requires sbt https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki
 * cd Into the akka-memcached directory and run `sbt package`
 * The jar will be located in target/scala-2.9.1

Usage
-----
 * Include this jar in your project
 * Create a new instance of RealMemcachedClient
 * When calling get or set on the client, it is necessary to have an implicit serializer within the scope
